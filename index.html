      <h3>My Dad:&nbsp;Samuel</h3>

         <ul>Zodiac Sign: Scorpio</ul>
         <ul>Occupation: Self-Employed Engineer</ul>
         <ul>Hobbies & Interests: Cooking, Home Improvement, and Story-telling</ul>
      <p>My dad, Samuel is incredibly hard-working, intelligent, and strong-willed.
         His hobbies of home improvement and cooking show how much the quality of life at home
         is important to him. My dad spent his early years in an island in Polillo, Philippines. Growing up
         with very little, school was very hard for him. Books, school uniforms, and lunches were
         usually out of reach which is why he strived to do well in school and eventually become an engineer.
         Fortunately, his hard work showed with the opportunity to move to the United States to fulfill
         his American Dream. Eventually, passing the dream onto his children, my Brother and I.

      <p>My bestfriend Grace is stylish, funky, and compassionate. Grace has a deep love for all things animals.
         One of her favorite animals is the highland cow. Currently, she lives with a bunny, a dog, and a cat.
         As a nursing student, not only is she compassionate about animals but people as well. She takes great
         care of those around her and just has a general concern that's unending. Grace and I met at 2016 and
         she also happens to be my Brother's girlfriend. I love having her around because we can talk forever
         and she has turned into family.

      <h3>My Boyfriend:&nbsp;Montana</h3>
      <img src="images/MontanaCamille.jpg" alt="Montana and Camille photo" width="460" height="400">
      <p>
         <ul>Zodiac Sign: Virgo</ul>
         <ul>Occupation: Ground Operations Agent</ul>
         <ul>Hobbies & Interests: Watching Anime, Video Games, and Playing Board Games</ul>
        <p>Montana is the most caring, funny, and strong-willed guy I know. He absolutely loves little cute items
         and trinkets. I would attribute that to his love of anime. While I worked with him I realized how 
         fast he learned new things. Montana is also very physically strong and I was quite impressed.
         Now, I'd like to share how we met.
         My boyfriend Montana and I have been dating for almost a year now. Him and I met when I worked
         at Southwest Airlines where we were hired into the same group. Furthermore, we bonded over complaining about
         work and playing video games. We found ourselves talking over the phone until 5 in the morning. Even
         my very first phone call with him I talked to him until 2 a.m.
         We started off as good friends and
         I realized I liked him more than a friend, thankfully, he felt the same way. Shortly after our trip to
         Hawaii as friends, we became a couple. The picture attached is of us as friends in Maui, Hawaii.
